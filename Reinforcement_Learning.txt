1. What is Reinforcement Learning\
- The goal of Reinforcement Learning is to learn a good strategy for the agent
from experimental trial and relative simple feedback received. Using the optimal
strategy the agent will actively adapt to the environment and maximize future rewards.
The goal is to maximize the total rewards. 

2. What is the Markov Decision Process?
- The future only depends on the current state, not the history. The future and the past
are conditionally independent given the present, as the current state encapsulates all 
the statistics we need to decide the future.

4. What are Policy Gradients?
